# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI Opponent

## Project Overview
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and the Pygame library. It features an AI opponent that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm for adversarial search. The aim of this project is to provide hands-on experience in implementing game-playing agents and understanding adversarial search algorithms.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install Pygame by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

### Running the Game
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the game using the command `python runner.py` or  `python3 runner.py` (if you have python 3 installed).
3. The game window should open, allowing you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI.

## How to Play
- Upon starting the game, you will be prompted to choose whether you want to play as X or O.
- Click on the board to make your move.
- The AI opponent will make its move following your turn.
- The game ends when one player wins or there is a tie.
- Click "Play Again" to restart the game after it ends.

## Features
- Graphical user interface for easy gameplay.
- AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal play.
- Ability to play multiple rounds without restarting the application.
- Visual feedback for game progress and outcomes.

## Project Structure
- `tictactoe.py`: Contains the logic for playing the game and making optimal moves.
- `runner.py`: Handles the graphical interface and user interactions.
